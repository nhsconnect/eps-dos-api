## Introduction ##

The EPS Directory of Service (DoS) API is an API providing information about dispensing services, and includes search functionality which lists dispensers who should be able to provide dispensing services for a patient with a given location and urgency.

{% include warning.html content="This site is provided for information only and is intended for those engaged with NHS Digital on the development of EPS services. It is advised not to develop against these specifications until a formal announcement has been made." %}

## Purpose ##

The EPS DoS API is a means of making existing information from NHS Choices, NHS Pathways and the NHS Organisation Data Service (ODS) available to prescribing systems from a single consolidated resource with a high degree of availability. Assured prescribing systems may use this to identify a dispenser who can meet a patient's needs and use this in sending prescriptions either via EPS or paper-based means.
