## Technical Accediation

The Technical Accreditation process for new API connections is a self-evaluationexercise, following the checklist provided in the [Target Operating Model](Target Operating Model - Prescription Tracker API - Self-Evaluation Checklist v1.0.xls) spreadsheet. There are two phases, with the first focussing on ensuring a legal basis exists for access to the information and assessed by NHS Digital; the second phase is conducted by the requesting organisation which evaluates the product against the TOM and must ensure it complies with the guidance and accepts any risks highlighted. 

The technical accreditation process is described in the Target Operating Model document. This process and document is expected to evolve. Currently the process is only available to assured EPS system suppliers.
