summary: A number of usage limits are in place to protect the service
---

In order to protect levels of service and ensure availability of the DoS API usage is tracked and requests at an excessively high rate may be rejected or have connections dropped. Continued excessive use may result in IP blacklisting. Crawling the API is discouraged and any crawler must respect the robots.txt crawl-delay directive. Where the complete dataset is required NHS Digital should be contacted in the first instance in order to arrange a snapshot.
